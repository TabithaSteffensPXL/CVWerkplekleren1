            <h1>Who am I?</h1>
            <p> I’m Tabitha Steffens, and I’ve learning continuously to be able to show you who I am and why I’m the
                perfect candidate! I am an American woman who’s lived and studied for two years in Belgium! Not only that, but I’ve
                put my soul into learning both Dutch and programming so that I can prove I have both the determination and
                the ability to keep up in such a fast-paced sector! My goal in life is to learn as much as I can in order to
                help people achieve their dreams both on and off the internet! Furthermore, I carry both the passion and
                empathy in order to work well with a team and ensure that all ideas are not only heard, but considered in a
                project. With my skill set, I am able to lead a project from concept to reality with ease. By
                considering all team members, we can reach new heights, and open doors previously closed. I hope that both my skills
                and competencies can prove that I’m the perfect candidate for both now and for the future. </p>

                        <p>I lent my hand to the construction of computer servers during my time in this position. I used both
                            the computer and my hands to label and verify cables and other materials to ensure that every server
                            had enough cables to be constructed properly. Furthermore, I worked dutifully with my team
                            to ensure that all required components were collected and documented to ensure a smooth transition to the team
                            that assembled the servers.</p>

                        <p>I had begun this position as an attendant, but within 6 months I was promoted due to my
                            attention to detail, my ability to work well both within a team and with customers, and my determination
                            to learn everything I needed to in order to provide a clean, fully functioning store by the end of the
                            night. As a manager, I trained new team members, I sent in tickets for anything that needed
                            repairs, and I performed many end of day actions such as verifying any sort of losses due to theft or
                            otherwise. I also many times verified the contents of the money safe on location and managed inventory of
                            certain items. I communicated extremely well not just within my own team about tasks at hand, but
                            also with other teams and also my superiors in the event that a problem arose that I couldn’t tackle alone.</p>

                        <p>I helped maintain the pet hotel by facilitating play time between the dogs. I am safety
                            certified in detecting stress levels in dogs and how to reduce that stress. Each day, I was responsible for
                            up to 14 dogs, who needed both time and attention each. I ensured that the room was well cleaned,
                            and verified that all water bowls had enough water.</p>

                            learned new methods each week in order to maximise both time and to meet bigger quotas. I verified that
                            each form was both correct and, if applicable, any and all payments were received and documented. </p>
